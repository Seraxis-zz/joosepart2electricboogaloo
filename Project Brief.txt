// Rough Notes

With the inital code being given, implementing superclasses, most of the classes inheriting 
the attributes are over-writing what is being inherited.
This leads to losing the benefits of reusability in inheritance, and subsequently - more code duplication.

With the inheritance method, we can also accidentally implement unintended side-effects to the subclasses, through 
a change in the superclass.

Behavious won't be assigned to the subclass until compile time.
